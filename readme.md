# Peppercorn: MealPlanner & Recipebook

The goal of this application is to let users manage their recipes, and create mealplans from their recipebook. Once they've created their mealplan for the week (or weeks), they'd be able to generate a grocery list to take the time and hassle away from them! In my own experience, I found that these mealplans can help save money, reduce food waste, and even cause you to lose weight (a byproduct of eating out less)! Bringing this application online I hope will make the process even easier for me, and improve the lives of countless other individuals.

## Roadmap & Current State

The development of this application will be phased. We are ***early*** in the first phase, still working on building out the Recipebook functionality.

1. Recipebook: Allow users to add, edit, categorize, and sort recipes
2. Mealplan: Allow users to create a food schedule from their recipebook
3. Groceries: Allow users to generate a list of groceries from their mealplan
4. Delivery: If possible, coordinate with food delivery platforms like ShopRite, FreshDirect, or Stop & Shop to automatically deliver the items for the mealplan.
